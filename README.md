Windows command line program for setting the internal clock of the Icom IC-7300 via OmniRig.

The application is written in C++ with Visual Studio.

Connection to OmniRig's Component Object Model is successful.  Time, date and offset are set.  Need to do more testing.  Especially OmniRig2 support needs to be tested.
